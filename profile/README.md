# Cell Migration Lab

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Cell Migration Lab! We are dedicated to understanding cell migration, focusing on cancer research. Our lab also develops image analysis tools to advance this field.

## About us
The cell migration lab is located in Turku, Finland. The lab started in 2019 and is part of the Cell Biology department and the Center of Excellence in Cellular Mechanostasis at Ã…bo Akademi University. We are part of the Solution for Health research profile and INFLAMES Flagship.

We are affiliated with Turku Bioscience Centre and use their core facilities for our research. In particular, we have access to state-of-the-art platforms related to genomics, zebrafish, proteomics, bioimaging, genome editing, and bioinformatics. Motivated students are always welcome to contact us!


## Our Software
We create cutting-edge tools for cell migration analysis, integrating advanced imaging and computational biology. These tools are designed to be user-friendly and open-source, making our research accessible to the wider scientific community.

## Open Data
Our commitment to open science extends to our datasets. We provide access to various datasets from our research, fostering collaboration and further innovation in the field.
