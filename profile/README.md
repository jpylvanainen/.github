Welcome to the GitHub repository of the [Cell Migration Lab](https://cellmig.org/)! We are dedicated to understanding cell migration, focusing on cancer research. Our lab also develops image analysis tools to advance this field.

## About us
The cell migration lab is located in Turku, Finland. The lab started in 2019 and is part of the Cell Biology department at [Ã…bo Akademi University](https://www.abo.fi/en/). We are part of the Solution for Health research profile and [INFLAMES Flagship](https://inflames.utu.fi/). We are affiliated with [Turku Bioscience Centre](https://bioscience.fi/) and use their core facilities for our research.
